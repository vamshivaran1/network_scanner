# Contributing

I welcome contributions to the network mapper script. There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, or writing code which can be incorporated into the network mapper script itself.

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check the existing [issues](https://github.com/[username]/network-mapper/issues). When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as much detail as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.

Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Requests

- **Fork the repository and clone it locally.** Connect your local to the original “upstream” repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from “upstream” often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
- **Create a branch** for your edits.
- **Make your changes**.
- **Test your changes**, make sure that the script still runs correctly.
- **Commit your changes** and push them to your fork
- **Create a new pull request** in GitHub's web interface.
- **Wait for feedback** from the maintainers.

## Coding conventions

- Follow PEP8 conventions.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.

Thanks for your contributions!
